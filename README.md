# Predicting Food Delivery Times

## üìå Project Description
This project focuses on predicting food delivery times using various factors such as **distance**, **weather conditions**, **traffic levels**, **time of day**, **vehicle type**, **preparation time**, and **courier experience**. The objective is to build a model that can accurately estimate delivery times, which can help optimize delivery logistics, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline operations for food delivery services.

## üéØ Goals
The primary goal of this project is to predict the **delivery time** (`Delivery_Time_min`) based on multiple features, including:
- Distance to the delivery address
- Weather conditions (Clear, Rainy, Windy, etc.)
- Traffic levels (Low, Medium, High)
- Time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- Vehicle type (Bike, Scooter, Car)
- Courier experience in years
- Order preparation time

**By building a predictive model, we aim to enhance the food delivery process, reducing delays and ensuring timely service to customers.**

## üìä Business Impact
By accurately predicting delivery times, this model can provide several business advantages:
1. **Improved Delivery Planning**: More accurate predictions of delivery times help food delivery services plan better, minimizing delays and improving customer satisfaction.
2. **Resource Optimization**: Knowing how long deliveries typically take based on different conditions allows businesses to allocate resources (like couriers and vehicles) more efficiently.
3. **Customer Experience**: By setting realistic delivery expectations based on predictive analytics, food delivery services can enhance the overall customer experience.
4. **Cost Savings**: Optimizing delivery times and resources can reduce unnecessary costs, improve courier efficiency, and reduce fuel and vehicle wear-and-tear.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, XGBoost, Hyperparameter Tuning, Gradio
- **Jupyter Notebook**, **VS Code**

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle with various features. Due to data size, the dataset is not included in this repository but can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/food-delivery-time-prediction).
